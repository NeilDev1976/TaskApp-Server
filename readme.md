# TaskApp-Server API

This repository contains the **API portion** of the Task Application, built as part of a **reskilling project**.

## Overview

- **Backend:** C# .NET Core minimal Web API  
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS (in a separate repository)  
- This API serves as the server-side logic for the Task Application.

## Current Status

- Minimal endpoints for demonstration and testing
- No database access yet
- No authentication yet

## Planned Enhancements

Future versions of this API will include:

- **Database integration** hosted on Azure  
- **Audit logs** for task and user activity  
- **OAuth authentication** for secure user access  
- Additional API endpoints to support new front-end functionality

## Purpose

The project is intended as a learning and reskilling exercise, growing gradually as new features are implemented.
